# How to Contribute

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please ensure your issue is not already reported by searching on GitHub under issues. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a clear title, description, and as much relevant information as possible. If you have a suggested fix for the issue, please include that as well.

## Pull Requests
We welcome pull requests! To get started, please fork the repository and create a new branch with a descriptive name (git checkout -b my-new-feature). When you've finished making changes, submit a pull request. Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository maintainers, and we may request changes or ask questions before merging it.

Please ensure your pull request includes tests for any new features or bug fixes you're introducing, and that all tests pass. Also, please ensure your code adheres to the existing style of the project.
